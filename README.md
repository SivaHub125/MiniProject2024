Mini Project : DETECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES IN ECG IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS
===================================================================================================================
In the research paper we read, a novel method for identifying cardiovascular disorders was presented.
We have used Python to put the suggested strategy into practice.  
We've also used SqueezeNet and AlexNet to compare accuracy.
